# Tableau Decomposition Tree Extension

Interactive hierarchical decomposition visualization for Tableau Desktop.

## Overview

This extension allows users to interactively drill down through multiple dimensions to understand the composition and drivers of key metrics, similar to Power BI's decomposition tree.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Interactive drill-down**: Click any node to expand by any dimension
- ‚úÖ **Multi-level exploration**: Support for unlimited levels deep
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic paths**: Each branch can follow different dimensions
- ‚úÖ **Collapse/Expand**: Click expanded nodes to collapse, click again to re-expand
- ‚úÖ **Real-time aggregation**: Calculates values by grouping underlying data
- ‚úÖ **Automatic percentage calculation**: Shows each child's percentage of parent

### Visual Features
- ‚úÖ **Smooth animations**: 250ms transitions for expand/collapse
- ‚úÖ **Hover tooltips**: Detailed information on mouse hover
- ‚úÖ **Clean design**: Professional node styling with proper spacing
- ‚úÖ **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate large trees easily
- ‚úÖ **Top 20 limiting**: Shows top 20 categories to avoid overwhelming display

### Configuration Options
- ‚úÖ **Measure selection**: Choose which measure to analyze
- ‚úÖ **Tree orientation**: Horizontal (left-to-right) or Vertical (top-to-bottom)
- ‚úÖ **Node colors**: Customize node color scheme
- ‚úÖ **Record counts**: Toggle visibility of record counts
- ‚úÖ **Settings persistence**: Configuration saves with workbook

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Open Tableau Desktop 25.2.3+** with a workbook containing data
2. **Add Extension** to your dashboard (Objects ‚Üí Extension)
3. **Browse to** `DecompositionTree.trex` in this folder
4. **Select a measure** from the dropdown
5. **Click the root node** to start exploring!

## Installation & Testing

### Step 1: Verify Files

Ensure you have these files in the `Decomposition_tree/` directory:
```
Decomposition_tree/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DecompositionTree.trex
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decomposition-tree.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Step 2: Start Local Web Server

**IMPORTANT:** Tableau requires extensions to be served over HTTP, not from local files.

**Option A: Double-click to start (easiest)**
- Double-click `start-server.command` in the Decomposition_tree folder
- A terminal window will open showing the server is running
- Keep this window open while using the extension

**Option B: Command line**
```bash
cd /Users/keithtroutt/Documents/my-claude-project/Decomposition_tree
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

You should see:
```
Starting local web server for Tableau Extension...
Extension will be available at: http://localhost:8000
```

**Keep the server running** - Don't close this terminal window!

### Step 3: Load Extension in Tableau Desktop

**This is a VIZ EXTENSION** - Add it directly to a worksheet!

1. **Open Tableau Desktop 2022.3+** (Viz extensions require 2022.3 or later)

2. **Create a worksheet** with data
   - Drag dimensions and measures to your worksheet
   - Your data should include:
     - One or more numeric measures (e.g., Sales, Profit, Quantity)
     - Multiple dimensions (e.g., Category, Region, Customer)

3. **Add the Extension to the worksheet**:
   - In the worksheet view, look for the **Analytics** pane (or Show Me)
   - Click on **"More Options"** (three dots) in the toolbar
   - Select **"Add Extension"** or find Extension in the Marks card area
   - **OR** Go to **Worksheet** menu ‚Üí **Show** ‚Üí **Extension**

4. **Browse to the manifest file**:
   - Click "Access Local Extensions"
   - Navigate to: `/Users/keithtroutt/Documents/my-claude-project/Decomposition_tree/`
   - Select: `DecompositionTree.trex`
   - Click "Open"

5. **Extension should load** from http://localhost:8000 and display "Extension loaded successfully"

**Note:** The extension will replace the current visualization in the worksheet view.

### Step 4: Using the Extension

1. **Select a Measure**:
   - Use the dropdown in the header to select which measure to analyze
   - The root node will appear with the total aggregated value

2. **Drill Down**:
   - Click on the root node
   - A modal will appear listing all available dimensions
   - Select a dimension to break down the data
   - The tree will expand showing child nodes

3. **Explore Further**:
   - Click on any child node to drill down further
   - Each branch can follow a different dimension path
   - Use the "Reset" button to return to the root

4. **Configure Settings** (‚öôÔ∏è):
   - Toggle record counts on/off
   - Change tree orientation (horizontal/vertical)
   - Customize node colors

- [ ] Settings persist after closing and reopening workbook
- [ ] Changes apply immediately

- [ ] Handles dimensions with special characters
- [ ] Handles very long dimension values (truncates properly)

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't load
- Verify the file path in `DecompositionTree.trex` matches your actual directory
- Check browser console (Ctrl+Shift+I in extension) for errors
- Ensure Tableau Desktop version is 25.2.3 or later

### No measures or dimensions appear
- Ensure your worksheet has data
- Check that worksheet has at least one measure and one dimension
- Try refreshing the data source

### JavaScript errors
- Open the browser console within the extension (right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
- Check for error messages
- Verify D3.js and Tableau Extensions API loaded correctly

## Development Notes

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses local `file://` URLs for Tableau Desktop
- Loads D3.js v7 and Tableau Extensions API from CDN
- Single-page application with vanilla JavaScript
- No external dependencies beyond D3.js

**Next Steps:**
- Implement real drill-down with Tableau data aggregation
- Add smooth animations and transitions
- Implement collapse/expand for nodes
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Testing with diverse workbooks

## Known Limitations

- **Top 20 limit**: Only shows top 20 categories per drill-down to maintain performance
- **Desktop only**: Currently configured for Tableau Desktop with local file:// URLs
- **Single worksheet**: Extension uses the first worksheet in the dashboard
- **Sum aggregation**: Currently uses SUM for aggregating measure values
- **No saved exploration paths**: Drill-down state is lost when closing workbook
- **Cloud deployment**: Requires HTTPS hosting (future enhancement)

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Best Practices
- **Start broad**: Begin with high-level dimensions (Region, Category) before drilling into details
- **Watch the counts**: Low record counts may indicate you've drilled too deep
- **Use percentages**: Focus on categories that represent significant portions of the total
- **Reset often**: Use the Reset button to start fresh when exploring different paths
- **Save your work**: Document interesting findings as the exploration state isn't saved

### Performance Tips
- For large datasets (100K+ rows), limit initial drill-downs to dimensions with lower cardinality
- The extension shows top 20 categories automatically - use more specific filters in Tableau if needed
- Use Tableau's native filters to pre-filter data before exploring in the tree

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If nodes show unexpected values, check Tableau's aggregation settings
- If dimensions don't appear, ensure they're included in the worksheet data
- For date dimensions, Tableau may aggregate them (Year, Quarter, etc.) - drill down accordingly
- Clear browser cache and reload if extension behaves unexpectedly
