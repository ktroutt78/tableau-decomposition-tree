# Decomposition Tree V2 — Enhancement Backlog

Enhancement IDs use the format **EBL-XXX**. Reference the ID when requesting an item to work on.

**Effort sizing:** S = a few hours · M = half to one day · L = one to two days · XL = multiple days / significant design work

---

## Backlog

| ID | Size | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| EBL-003 | **XL** | **View underlying data from tooltip** | Add a button inside the tooltip to open a detail drawer showing all rows that make up the selected node — displaying dimension attributes from the Marks card. Requires a new modal/table component, row pagination for large datasets, and formatting logic. |
| EBL-014 | **S** | **Connector line thickness and line type** | Add to Settings (Connectors section) a control for connector line thickness and a control for line type (solid line, dotted, dashed). Persist via extension settings and apply stroke-width and stroke-dasharray in link rendering. |

### v2.0 — Core rewrite (Svelte + D3)

| ID | Description |
|---|---|
| C-001 | Initial v2 rewrite: Svelte + D3 tree with drill-down, collapse/expand, encoding map |
| C-002 | Animated bar fill transitions (width for LR, height for TB) |
| C-003 | Tooltip with value, %, and custom tooltip fields |
| C-004 | Empty state shown before a measure is added |
| C-005 | Zoom controls (zoom in, fit to view, zoom out) with pan support |
| C-006 | Settings panel (ConfigPanel) with save/load via Tableau extension settings |
| C-007 | Node width, level spacing, sibling spacing, bar height controls |
| C-008 | Link style setting: Curved, Step, Straight |
| C-009 | Background color picker |
| C-010 | Negative value color picker |
| C-011 | Bar corner radius control |
| C-012 | Color theme presets (Ocean, Forest, Amethyst, Sunset, Teal) + Custom gradient |
| C-013 | Gradient on/off toggle — solid color when off, gradient by value rank when on |
| C-014 | Gradient direction: default themes darkest = largest; Custom: first color = largest |
| C-015 | Font size controls for heading and subheading (number inputs) |
| C-016 | Font family selector: System, Serif, Monospace |
| C-017 | Heading and subheading color pickers |
| C-018 | Label mode: Value & %, Value only, % only |
| C-019 | Show measure name toggle (prefix value line with measure name) |
| C-020 | Show group count (replaces meaningless record count) |
| C-021 | Exclude nulls toggle — hides null/empty dimension members when drilling |
| C-022 | Value format: Auto (Tableau native), Number, Currency, Percentage |
| C-023 | Measure alias / custom display name — auto-strips aggregation prefix on load |
| C-024 | Sibling auto-drill — clicking undrilled sibling reuses the same dimension |
| C-025 | One-at-a-time expansion — drilling a sibling collapses previously expanded sibling |
| C-026 | (Other) grouping — excess children aggregated into a single overflow node |
| C-027 | Max children shown control with live re-drill on change |
| C-028 | Alignment control (Top / Centered) for LR orientation |
| C-029 | Top-left alignment with `topAlignHier` post-processing |
| C-030 | GitHub Pages deployment from `docs/` folder |

### v2.2 — Dashboard interaction & tooltip

| ID | Description |
|---|---|
| EBL-001 | Dashboard Actions — bar click selects marks in Tableau, triggering native "Use as Filter" to propagate selection to other sheets on the dashboard; click again or click background to clear |
| EBL-002 | Dim unselected nodes on click — sibling nodes fade to 30% opacity when a node is selected; clears on deselect or background click |
| EBL-004 | Tooltip narrative template — config-driven textarea replaces default tooltip rows; supports `<measure>`, `<value>`, `<pct>`, `<count>`, dimension path, and tooltip shelf field placeholders; pre-filled with default layout as a starting point |
| EBL-005 | Connector color settings — active path, inactive, and negative color pickers plus opacity slider in a Connectors section; inactive always grey, negative color only applied on the active path |
| EBL-009 | Onboarding drill hint — white callout bubble with blue + icon replica and instructional text appears below root node on load; disappears when root is drilled, reappears on collapse or reload |
| EBL-006 | Bar scale mode — three-way control in Layout settings: Parent (default, relative to parent value), Top Node (relative to root total), Level Max (relative to largest value at same depth) |
| EBL-007 | Column header formatting — font size and color controls for dimension column headers ("▸ by Region") in Settings under a dedicated Column Headers section |
| EBL-010 | Tooltip fixes — title now wraps instead of truncating; hint text updated to reference actual +/− buttons ("Click + to drill into an attribute", etc.); row label and body text darkened to primary color |
| EBL-011 | Smart zoom on drill — after each new drill, D3 zoom animates to frame only the drilled parent + its new children; full-tree fit-to-view button still available; Settings toggle (on by default) to revert to fit-all behavior |
| EBL-008 | Preserve deep expansion pattern when switching siblings — clicking an un-drilled sibling now replays the full multi-level drill path from the expanded sibling using `reapplyExpansion`, restoring all nested dimensions and collapse states |
| EBL-012 | In-viz help overlay — `?` button in the upper-right corner opens an animated popover explaining all controls (drill/collapse, bar select, column header sort, zoom in/out, fit to view, smart zoom, max children); dismisses on outside click or Escape |
| EBL-013 | Save decomposition tree expansion state — persist expansion state (which nodes are drilled, dimension at each level, sort order, collapse/expand) via Tableau extension settings; replay saved state after initial data load |

### v2.1 — Interaction & layout refinements

| ID | Description |
|---|---|
| C-031 | Preserve expansion on filter changes — replay drill path on fresh data |
| C-032 | Preserve expansion on measure changes |
| C-033 | Max children change immediately re-groups (Other) without collapse/expand |
| C-034 | Sort order selection in Drill Into picker (Ascending / Descending) |
| C-035 | Sort stored per node (`_sortOrder`) and replayed on data refresh |
| C-036 | Sort arrows in column headers — clickable ↑/↓ to toggle sort inline |
| C-037 | Column header display bug fix — header no longer disappears after first collapse |
| C-038 | Sort toggle collapse bug fix — toggling sort no longer expands collapsed siblings |
| C-039 | Expand/collapse button moved outside node card (right of bar in LR, below bar in TB) |
| C-040 | Link source adjusted to exit after expand button in LR mode |
| C-041 | Top-Bottom orientation: vertical column bars, labels to the right, button below bar |
| C-042 | TB label text wrapping — labels wrap to fit available width using tspan elements |
| C-043 | Value text y-position shifts dynamically based on number of wrapped label lines |
| C-044 | Percentage sign fix — % always matches the sign of the child value |
| C-045 | Alignment control renamed from "Initial Alignment" to "Alignment"; Top option listed first |
